# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers Vision-Language-Action integration for creating intelligent humanoid robots with natural human interactions.

## Overview

This module is divided into three main sections:

1. **Week 11**: Voice-to-action integration and Whisper integration
2. **Week 12**: Embodied AI, humanoid control, and LLM integration
3. **Week 13**: Capstone project and system integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Integrate voice recognition and action execution systems
- Implement OpenAI Whisper for voice-to-text processing
- Build language-to-action translation systems
- Integrate LLMs for cognitive planning in robotics
- Complete a comprehensive capstone project integrating all modules
- Master system integration patterns for complex robotics applications
