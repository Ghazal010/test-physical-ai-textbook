# Course Overview

## Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This 13-week course teaches students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions. It covers the complete journey from digital AI to physical embodied intelligence.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1/)
**Weeks 1-5**: Introduction to Physical AI and ROS 2 fundamentals

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2/)
**Weeks 6-7**: Simulation environments and digital twins

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](/docs/module-3/)
**Weeks 8-10**: AI integration and perception systems

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/module-4/)
**Weeks 11-13**: Human-robot interaction and capstone project

## Target Audience

Students with basic programming knowledge (Python) but no robotics background. Complex concepts are made accessible through clear explanations, practical examples, and step-by-step tutorials.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Course Format

Each week includes:
- Learning objectives
- Prerequisites check
- Theoretical concepts
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Code examples with explanations
- Hands-on exercises
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Review questions
- Project assignment
- Further resources

## Course Philosophy

This course follows the principle of "Accessibility First" - breaking down complex concepts into digestible steps while maintaining technical accuracy. Every theory is paired with practical examples, and students are encouraged to experiment and build upon the provided code examples.

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Prerequisites](/docs/about/prerequisites) to ensure you have the required background
2. Examine the [Learning Outcomes](/docs/about/learning-outcomes) to understand what you'll achieve
3. Check the [Hardware Requirements](/docs/resources/hardware-requirements) to ensure your system meets specifications
4. Begin with [Module 1](/docs/module-1/) to establish the foundational concepts

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI and discover how to create intelligent, embodied systems that can interact naturally with the physical world!
