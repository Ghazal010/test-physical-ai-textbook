# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module covers digital twin technologies using Gazebo and Unity simulation environments.

## Overview

This module is divided into two main sections:

1. **Week 6**: Gazebo Simulation basics and URDF/SDF robot models
2. **Week 7**: Unity integration and multi-sensor fusion techniques

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Master Gazebo simulation environment setup and configuration
- Understand URDF and SDF robot model formats
- Integrate Unity with ROS 2 for advanced simulation
- Implement multi-sensor fusion techniques
- Create realistic simulation environments for robotics
