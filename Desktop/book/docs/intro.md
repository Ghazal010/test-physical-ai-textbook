# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This 13-week course teaches students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions. It covers the complete journey from digital AI to physical embodied intelligence.

## Course Overview

This textbook teaches students how to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions. It covers the complete journey from digital AI to physical embodied intelligence.

### Target Audience
Students with basic programming knowledge (Python) but no robotics background. Complex concepts are made accessible through clear explanations, practical examples, and step-by-step tutorials.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1/)
**Weeks 1-5**: Introduction to Physical AI and ROS 2 fundamentals

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2/)
**Weeks 6-7**: Simulation environments and digital twins

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](/docs/module-3/)
**Weeks 8-10**: AI integration and perception systems

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/module-4/)
**Weeks 11-13**: Human-robot interaction and capstone project

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
